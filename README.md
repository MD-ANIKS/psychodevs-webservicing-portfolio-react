# Psychodevs Web Servicing Portfolio (React)

Welcome to the Psychodevs Web Servicing Portfolio repository! This repository showcases Psychodevs' expertise in web servicing and front-end development using React, Bootstrap, and Material-UI. The portfolio website is designed to be visually appealing, and responsive, and highlight Psychodevs' skills in creating stunning user interfaces.

## Live Website

Check out the live version of the portfolio website [here]([https://md-aniks.github.io/psychodevs-webservicing-portfolio-react/]).

## Features

- **React**: The portfolio website is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture that enables the creation of reusable and modular UI elements.

- **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is utilized to enhance the responsiveness and visual appeal of the portfolio website. It provides a robust set of CSS and JavaScript components that aid in rapid website development.

- **Material-UI**: Material-UI is another UI framework used in this portfolio, adding a touch of Material Design aesthetics to the user interface. It offers a rich collection of ready-to-use components and styles.

- **SCSS**: The project has been enhanced with the integration of SCSS (Sassy CSS), a CSS preprocessor that extends the capabilities of traditional CSS. SCSS allows for nested selectors, variables, mixins, and more, simplifying the styling process and improving code maintainability.
